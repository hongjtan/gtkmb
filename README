What is GTKMB?

GTKMB, short for GTK Media Box, is a media player written for a college project back in Spring 2010 using the GTK+ toolkit and the gstreamer framework, along with the Taglib, GnomeVFS, and the Totem Playlist Parser libraries running on Ubuntu 10. It has all of the functionality of a basic media player plus basic playlist functionality.

How do I run the app?

In order to run GTKMB, you will first need to install the following, either through apt-get or through the Synaptic Package Manager:
   -   GTK+ Toolkit 2.18+, currently not compatible with GTK+ 3.0.0+
   -   gstreamer Framework (gstreamer0.10, libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-0-dev)
   -   Taglib C Bindings (libtagc0-dev)
   -   GnomeVFS 2.0 Libraries (libgnomevfs2-dev)
   -   Totem Playlist Parser Libraries (libtotem-plparser-dev)
   -   gcc (build-essential)

Once you have all of those installed, just type make to compile the application and then ./gtkmb to run the program.
